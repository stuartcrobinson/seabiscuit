earnings downloaders:

should download going forward starting with the last-modified date of the downloaded file.  in case data on those earnings changed since then.  actually whichever's smaller - the last recorded date, or the last-modified date


i think it would be better if there was a Download object that extended to different downloaders.  and then put the downloaders inside the objects folder/package



what's the MO for exceptions?  

1.   do we want each downloader to be bulletproof?  and handle all exceptions internally?
2.   do we want to catch all exceptions per each ticker's download? -- YES
3.   do we want to catch all exceptions per the ticker loop?
4.   do we want to catch all exceptions per the entire downloader?
5.   do we watn to cathcall exlcasldkfj in the agent?  let the downloader throw them up?qQ
