Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Twitter to report 6 cents in EPS and $453.1 million in revenue. 
The company had earned 2 cents on revenue of $242.68 million in the corresponding quarter a year ago. 
Investors have been calling for the ouster of Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. Under pressure, he has rolled out a lot of new features.
Many of the new features came in the current quarter, so their impact may not reflect in the Q4 results.

http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/01/microsoft-apple-facebook-earnings-preview/
 The company is expected to post earnings of $0.33 per share, up from $0.20 per share the same quarter last year. 
Analysts also expect the company to post revenue of $3.78 billion, marking a 46% increase on a year-over-year basis.

stuart - note - eps was .25 instead of .3.  it looks like the stock fell about 0.7% in the morning, but then was back up by evening.
profiting from earnings disappointments may be too risky
